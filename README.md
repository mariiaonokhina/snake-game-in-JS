## Yes, this is Snake Game!

This version of the popular game was made as a project showcasing my Javascript skills. My goal is to make an interesting small game with several levels.

## Implemented features:
- Added a start game screen.
- Play this game with WASD or arrows.
- Snake has 1 revival before game over. If the game is over, you can restart the game.
- Snake gets hurt by biting itself or bumping into a wall.
- Sounds played when the snake gets hurt differ depending on what caused it.
- Snake respawns in a random place close to the middle of the screen.
- Every time the snake dies, its length is shortened.
- Apples randomly appear on the map. Eating 1 apple gives you +10 score.
- Heart (revival) produces a heartbeat sound when clicked.

## Planned features:
- Add levels with obstacles.
- Add rules to the game.
